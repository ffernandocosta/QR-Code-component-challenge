## My process

I started doing the HTML content first, adding all the items first and creating classes for each one of them so I can style one by one later.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to approach a challenge using Mobile-first workflow, then adding media queries to adapt to desktop version. I got to practice Display flex, how to add root variables to my css, linking google fonts to my project and positioning elements, padding, margin and width.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
  <main>
      <section class="qr-code">
        <article class="qr-code__box">
          <img src="images/image-qr-code.png" class="qr-code__img">
          <h1 class="qr-code__title">Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>
          <p class="qr-code__text">Scan the QR code to vise Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
        </article>
      </section>
  </main>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  background-color: var(--white);
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  padding: 1em 1em 2em 1em;
  margin: 2em;
  border-radius: 15px;
  text-align: center;
}
```


### Continued development

I want to tackle display grid on my next project and really dive in on more complex pages with forms and more css styles properties.
